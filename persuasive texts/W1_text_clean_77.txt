There are millions of people in the world today. They are all out trying to make a living for themselves, their families and their friends. It is important to them to be the best to earn the best income. Being good at one's job as a nurse, doctor or lawyer is imperative to earn good money. However, what is the best strategy? Would it be to make money the fastest or the smartest? Would it be to over-power the competition or work with them? I believe that working cooperatively with each other is better than being in a competition with another so that you can help others, learn from others and make a good profit together.As a nursing student, I have to apply to the Byrdine School of Nursing this week. There are only seventy-two spots available, and the school gets about three hundred applications. I understand that spots are limited. However, I believe that the best strategy is to work with my fellow students instead of fighting for the seat. I would feel more accomplished and I know that it will increase my chances if I learn from my peers instead of harming each other's opportunities. If we all help each other, then there will a better chance of being accepted as a group with the highest grades. Throughout my college experiences, I have learned new information on several topics. These topics have guided me to teach other people. When my friends have trouble understanding Chemistry, Anatomy or Microbiology, it is easier for me to help them if I already learned it in college. Together, we will all be more successful on a test if we help each other study rather than failing on the day of the exam.It is easier to help each other than to think of everyone as your competition. It makes the process easier and there is no failures. Everyone does their best to fight off the negativity and passes together.
