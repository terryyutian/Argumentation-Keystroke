In a competition, some people, who may not know each other, fight to win against the others. Whereas cooperation embodies solidarity and friendship. Both type of working seems able to bring success for the candidates. However, one may be more efficient than the other. First, we will study how competition can stimulate people and bring them success. Then, we will see that cooperation is also a powerful way to achieve success, by a more modern way.First, competition stimulate candidates, it pushes them to win. In a competition, most of the time people don't know each other. Their are just strangers that fight to win the expected prize. In sport, competition seems to be the most efficient way for people to stimulate themselves because they have nothing to loose, they trained the whole year for the competition they have waited for. Competition pushes people to do their best in order to be recognize as the best in their field, they barely want to loose in their own field...However, another way to achieve success is cooperation. Indeed, as cooperation epitomizes friendship, people know each other or are getting to know each other. They must act as responsible and adult persons because they have to work with people that may not have the same personality and views. Thus, cooperation allow groups to combine their knowledge in different fields to be more successful as if they were alone. In enterprises, cooperation seems to be more efficient than competition because people can share ideas, create with more brains and thus evolve themselves. To conclude, I think that cooperation is more efficient to achieve success in the modern world where there are more and more people and more and more knowledge in every field. One person cannot know everything so sharing is the only way to be really successful.
