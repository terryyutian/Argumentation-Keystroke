We all have heard the famous saying: "Your first impression is the most important". People judge, and they judge very quickly. Just by one look, people know if they like or they don't like a product, a person, an animal, even a TV show. That's why either a politician, a teacher, or a seller, any person trying to persuade the masses must give good impressions. Images and impressions definitely have a very big impact on people.A very famous example of this is the brand "Nike". People can argue that Nike is in fact, superior in quality to the other brands, or that it simply isn't that superior. But what we cannot argue is how the media and propaganda have made Nike the biggest sport brand in history. Those commercials where you can see Cristiano Ronaldo being better that everyone, or even outrunning a Bugatti "thanks to the Nike shoes" have a big impact in people. Athletes, soccer players, kids, fans, all doing huge lines so they can buy those shoes. Shoes that in one month will be out of style, because Cristiano is using a new ones that make him "even better". And people will go again to those huge lines for buying Nike shoes.  Politicians hire people that their unique labor is to study the populations likes, and based on the study decide if he or she, should use a green, blue, or red tie or dress. We can like more a candidate for those small details that we don't even notice. But it definitely impacts us. Just with a convenient warm smile, or a calculated joke politicians turn people in their favors. And is not because of a smart or logic reason, is just because of those impressions that make people like more someone or something.Either we like it or not, impressions are very powerful in our world. And the ability to give good impressions is what, at the end will make the difference between those who are successful and those who aren't.
