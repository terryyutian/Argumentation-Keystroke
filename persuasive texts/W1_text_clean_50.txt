In my opinion, images and impressions have an effect on people. For example, we recently saw an advertisement of Dove cosmetics where we can see a Black lady wearing a black t-shirt and while she is removing the shirt she is changing into a White girl who is also changing afterwards to Asian girl. It created a lot of heat on social medias, the advertisement was to show that the soap Dove was for Black, White or any other ethnicity but people interpreted it as being Black is being dirty when you take a shower with Dove you become clean which is being White. People were offended which lead Dove to publicly apologize. It was a video that last less than five minutes but it created a debate for almost a week all over social medias. With picture, a salutation, an attitude we can either transmit on people anger, disappointment or happiness. We live in a world where communication can be made via flyer, selfie or short video, so we have to be careful of what we decide to share or to transmit to others. It can be inoffensive but still be harmful. For instance, a 22 years old girl who is originally from Africa goes on vacation to Miami and decide to post a picture in bikini on Instagram. In American culture it is just a picture with bikini on, but in African culture it shows a lack of education and maturity. Nowadays, information goes really fast with the use of internet, it is our responsibility to transmit on other a positive effect.
