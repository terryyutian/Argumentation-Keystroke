Humans are drawn to colorful images by nature. We developed the skills as hunter-gather groups to pick up the best sources food.  Vision supersedes every other senses when it comes to sensory. Psychologists and marketers have taken this evolutionary skills to their disposal. In the theaters, people often perceive the audio source comes from the front, but in fact, it comes from their back. This phenomenon happens because people see images being flashed in front of them. This vision sense trumps the audio information coming from the ears, altering their sense of space within the theater room. Therefore, images and impression does create huge impression on people. There are ways for people to overcome this disadvantage but the most important is education. People can educate themselves on the matters. No matter how much of a powerful image, if one is informed it was a lie, they would not fall for it. They should also consult multiple sources of information, on both sides of the spectrum to avoid being manipulated. There is no clear way to change this phenomenon as it is so deeply instilled in our human nature. We cannot rewire our brain from getting the information it needs. But that does not mean we cannot protect ourselves from being preyed by others for their own selfish benefits.
