In my opinion, cooperation is much more efficient and useful as compared to competition. As the saying goes, "Two minds is greater than one." With cooperation, you can have the minds of countless people all thinking together to reach or achieve a similar goal. Those people can bounce off each other's ideas and there would be more ideas "created".  Cooperation also allows for the participants to build and grow with each other. As ideas come and go, everyone would bring different perspectives and suggestions to the table, which can create a wealth of information that can be used. In the case of a mistake, you can always trust your teammates to catch and correct them, but that would not be the case for competition. Cooperation also allows for, up to a certain extent, specialization. You can often split the work for a big project into smaller chunks, and designate each chunk to a person or a group of people who are better in that field. This way, everyone's skills and abilities will be fully used. On the flip side, if it were competition, that one person or one group has to know how to do every single aspect of that project, and it makes the whole task more challenging. With competition, however, every person is only trying to think of a potential solution with one mind, and attempting to be the fastest or the first to come up with a viable outcome. There are many problems with this approach. First, it is hard to come up with brand new ideas from scratch without any help or input from others to help speed up the brainstorm process. Second of all, if everyone is rushing to compete with each other, sometimes solution would not be as good as they could have been, as the person would want to make it known as soon as possible and not think of more ways to improve it. Last but not least, as I mentioned before, it is the mistakes that we make. Catching others' mistakes is easy, but catching your own is not as easy task.
