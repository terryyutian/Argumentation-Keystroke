Nowadays images are everywhere around us. It's not only about advertisements in the street and commercials on TV. We have Internet with social media such as Facebook and Instagram. These images influence our lives even if we are not always aware that they do as we are used to it. With the new technology people can post pictures within a few minutes or even less. Because we still pay attention to images some people spend a lot of times choosing what they are going to put on their accounts. And other people spend a lot of time watching those images. We see everyday thin models on magazines and Instagram and people may think this is how their bodies should look like. This can cause important problems because if people pay too much attention to images they tend to forget that the reality is different. Some countries have passed laws asking brands using Photoshop to mention it on their advertisements as it influences the population.It can also be noticed with polemical images. A few days ago someone tried to show that a commercial was racist by posting two different images from the commercial. People started thinking the all brand was racist while they didn't know that the commercial didn't stop there and had an all different meaning. For these reasons politicians are using pictures to make their point and it works. A public figure seen doing something wrong even if the context is not entirely clear can see is all career being affected. Images have real effects on people and not only on their behaviors but also on their lives. Images and impressions do have too much on an effect on people from both sides: the people who look at them and the people who post them.
