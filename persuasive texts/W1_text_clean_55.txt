I believe that there are some situations in which cooperation is more effective but there are also other situations in which competition is more effective. I believe that overall, competition is achieves more successes overall per individual because it drives people to get out of their comfort zone in hopes of one-uping someone else on a certain task. Competition encourages people to try their best in order to gain confidence and winning at the end of the day. Although, in some situations, people do not value winning or losing, so in these cases, competitiveness does not effect the drive of either participants. On the other hand, when it comes to group activities and team building, cooperation is extremely helpful. This idea allows people to learn new things from others and build on their own beliefs. This could not be done individually through competition. In conclusion, both competition and cooperation achieve success but in their own ways and situations. Both provide pros and cons in certain situations and should be used according to the individuals and situations at hand.
