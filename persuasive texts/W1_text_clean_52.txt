I believe that cooperation can lead people to achieve more success than competition. Although competition can drive people to passionately compete against one another and lead to greater individual achievement, the cooperative output by a group is more likely to be greater than that of a single person. For example, if given a task to move 100 chairs to the other side of the room, competition would lead unnecessary waste of time as an individual would have to spend time to carry and run across the room back and forth. In a cooperative setting, the group can stand in a line resembling conveyor belt and hand the chair over to the next person. This would allow for more efficient use of energy and lead to greater achievement. People who argue that competition is the only way to achieve success fail to see that there are numerous real-life situations in which competition would be severely ineffective. If a team of specialists were gathered to construct a car, each of the specialists would have to work together to complete the goal. The designer would have to debate with the engineer to see if his or her design is realistically possible and vice versa. If the team were to compete against each other, the end product would simply be ideas on a paper. It is true that competition can lead people to strive for better results, but the greatest of results can only be achieved by cooperation. The Moon Landing was a product of national competitiveness between the U.S. and the USSR, but those behind the great accomplishment was an group of elite NASA scientists from different disciplines working together day and night to achieve this success.
