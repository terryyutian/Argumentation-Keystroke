The question of whether people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition is one that has no definite answer. Although many people believe that success is achieved by competition the more likely answer is that it is achieved by cooperation. It is achieved by cooperation because it allows different minds to put their knowledge together in order to output something that an individual cannot. More can be attained when people work together compared to that of an individual. Although competition can help push people passed their limits, working together will in the end create a result that an individual cannot achieve alone. In today's society people rarely achieve success without the help of others. This is why cooperation between individuals will always result in more success than competition.
