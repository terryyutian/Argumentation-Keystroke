In the social media, people are like colorful packages in stores. They look nice and attractive, but when it comes to the reality, they look less attractive then they appearance on social media. For examples, some Celebrities appearance are more importance then their ability, I think it is because they are more attractive then normal people. People will take then to be their model to their life. Impression are really importance on people. Because they won't take people with bad impression as their model. There are a lot of examples for " appearances are mistaken for reality". Such as, advertisements. we see a lot of ads on TV, computers and out phones. The companies always says how good their products are. They makes people buy their products. But after their customers got their things, there is always people complaining about the products.
