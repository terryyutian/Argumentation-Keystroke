In today's society people often tend to perceive the character of a person by their appearances. Appearances can be mistaken and as the old adage goes all that glitters is not gold. Our whole society is build on appearance and image. Media and advertisements takes full advantage of this scenario.Companies recruit top models and actors to advertise their products. We often buy things which seems to be appealing to us. For example if an expensive cosmetic product is advertised by one of the top actors or models, people would still buy it so they can look like them. Advertisements also uses bright colors and patterns to attract viewers. People pay more attention to the way a certain commodity is packed, designed rather than paying more attention to the content.These misconceptions also exist in media where politicians, entertainers and other public figures are more important than their ability to perform. In Hollywood for instance, a person with good looks would get roles than an average looking person with the abilities. We are blinded by the outward beauty that we forget to look into another persons abilities and talents.
