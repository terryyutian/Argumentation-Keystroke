Both Cooperation and Competition have been shown to lead to results in our nation's history, but one of those has yielded more results, and that would be Competition. It's a driving force that motivates individuals against each other to out do each other and produce results to help better understand what they were competing in. One major example was the Cold War. If it weren't for the Cold war, the United states of America wouldn't be the super power it is today. The Cold war Sparked Competition between the Soviet Union and the united states to develop nuclear weapons. With the development of these weapons, the united states was able to succeed in tuning their military and boasting to have the strongest military in the world.
