People achieve more success by competition. In order to succeed more by cooperation, there has to be new information and help gained by all members of the group by others in the areas where they lack. Therefore, cooperation is only successful if all members of the group participate efficiently and work productively. If some of the members are not as productive as others, or an individual, the achievement of one member of the group does not improve. However, competition motivates individuals to achieve more and work harder. In competition, the only way to win is to make sure to have better information, productivity and knowledge than other competitors in the competition. In order to achieve victory, individuals always strive to be better. Victory brings out hidden motivation within people, and with motivation and no one to cooperate with, individuals can better focus on their own work at their own pace, which enables them to be more successful in the end.
