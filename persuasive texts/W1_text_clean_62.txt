While some people may argue that competition may be the only way to achieve success, I believe that cooperation is deemed better for those who are working towards a mutual goal, rather than one's self. A prime example of this is restaurant industry. While working in the restaurant in America, servers become competitive because unlike cooks or hosts, they don't get paid salary as their main source of income; they rely on customer tipping. Servers go out of their way to make the customer enjoy their stay at the restaurant to both please them and please themselves. This becomes a problem when servers find out that certain customers tip more than others; the ones who spend the most and who doesn't. The servers become picky and prioritize those guests instead of others. Meanwhile, the rest of the servers scramble to seek any help from anyone to make their jobs less hectic. This intense rivalry for greed is a significant stick in the mud because not only are certain servers making a killing on the restaurant floors, but others don't get a chance at greatness nor do they have any way to get a better income. Cooperation, however can make the workplace much more fluid. When servers start to show sympathy or consideration around the workplace, they can make a big difference. If servers run each other's orders while the other one is busy, or if a lucky server with a wealthy customer share details with the others to introduce and share details can make the servers and the restaurant itself look and feel like a more solid establishment. It is better to lose some battles while you win the war; one may have to surrender a hefty tip out to help out others. Nevertheless, cooperation trumps over competition when it comes to working towards a mutual goal over self worth.
