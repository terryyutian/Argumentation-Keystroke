Yes, images have a great effect on people because it causes us to self doubt ourselves especially through social media. I have always grown up with slow self esteem so the influences of social media have caused this to increase. Also, images cause us to picture ourselves in a different perspective. It gives us false images of ourselves. Although, there are negative connotations with self image, there are positive attributes. For example, the images in magazines can help us feel more confident about ourselves. If I were to look in a plus size magazine, and see beautiful models, I would be inspired and motivated to be more confident.
