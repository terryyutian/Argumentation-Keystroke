       It is clear that human beings are affected by what they see or hear. We like to think that we are rational beings but the truth is that we are often affected by our senses which can distort reality. Nowadays, advertisements and media are much more sophisticated and they are able to change the way we perceive reality. Indeed, they used developed techniques that have the ability to find their way into our brains to convince us that what we see is the reality. For instance, ads are only here to persuade us that we need this new product which is portrayed as vital for us whereas in reality the product is nothing new or vital.       As human beings we are easily misguided by our senses and especially today. In fact the development of technologies have increased this effect. We are now constantly surrounded by images, ads, medias and so; and we have little time or place to think. Thus, it can be said that images have become much more important than reflection. We do not adopt a product or adhere to an idea because we agree or because it is the truth but because it is portrayed as so and we don't question it. What we see on the TV, on magazines and the impressions that we have are more important that what really are the things broadcast. If it is portrayed as useful, right, good and so we simply believe it is because images affect us so much that we don't think about questioning what we see.       Therefore, I think that we should diminish the time that we spend being surrounded by images. This will allow us to focus on the reality. For example we should spend less time watching TV or surfing on the net and we should meditate more and spend more time contemplating the world and thinking about everything and anything. We should also be aware of the techniques used by the medias, the advertisements and the politicians to persuade us to adhere to their ideas. And finally we should not be afraid to question what we see.
