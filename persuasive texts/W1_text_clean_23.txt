I believe that people achieve more by competition rather than cooperation as in a competition, the driving force for an individual is to win the competition. This allows an individual to think about new ideas which purely belongs to him. Also, when person is in competition, he/she is not dependent on others and must work wholeheartedly. Whereas, when we are in cooperation, people are dependent on each other and tend to be lazy and learn less. I also believe that self learning is the best learning in this world. When we learn things on our own then we remember them for rest of our lives and hence it helps in achieving success.
