The question about whether to cooperate or to compete has long been a question. Even in biology some animals show either mutualistic behavior or selfish behavior, which could be compared to cooperate or compete. The tragedy of the common for example deals with that selfish individuals can prosper in a society which emphasizes cooperation and working together in groups.Some psychologists did experiments on this topic. A famous experiment is the "prisoners dilemma". Two participants are blamed for a crime. They have to answer questions separately. If both remain silent, none of them will be charged. If one of them blames the other one, he can go and the other one gets convicted. If they both blame the other one, both will be convicted. The participants are not allowed to talk to each other and they don't know how their partner answers the questions. A good solution for this game is to cooperate in the first round and then do what your partner did to you in the next round.In my opinion, cooperation should always be the first thing to try. We live in a social world and humans like to interact with each other. Therefore we should always try to get along with our partners/colleagues? friends...If we are let down by somebody (especially more than once) we can still change our behavior.Apart from that, competition can become a real problem at your work place. It just creates an environment nobody feels comfortable in and it increases stress at your workplace. Unfortunately a lot of companies encourage their employees in competitive behaviors because they want the best one for the highest position. This creates the impression that more people achieve success by showing competitive actions. Changing the structure in our society and emphasizing cooperation would be a good way to decrease stress and pressure individuals feel when they do have to compete.
