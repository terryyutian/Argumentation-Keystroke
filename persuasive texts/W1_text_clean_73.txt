The goal of a competition is to be better than his opponent. The goal of cooperation is to communicate and find common ideas in order to find a solution to a problem or to achieve a task. I think that people achieve more success by competition because in a competition, you will give the best of you. In a cooperation situation, some people are more likely to hope that others will find ideas for them. I play tennis and I will try to demonstrate that. When you play tennis, you have mainly two types of practice. The first one is to drill with your opponent (the goal is to improve your skills by repeating the same exercise many times). The second one is a practice match (you play a match against your partner). I noticed that I was trying harder when I was playing a match than when I was drilling. The fact that I am trying harder increases my chances to achieve success. The purpose in a competition is to win. If you want to win, and you know your opponent (s) want to win as well, it makes the competition really interesting and you will try harder in order to beat your opponent. Rivalry helps people to improve or develop something. Cooperation can help too, but I do not think it is as efficient as competing. Though, cooperation is more likely to avoid conflicts. In competition, you could cheat and make the competition unfair. In this case, cooperation is a better way.My conclusion is that competition is better. It helps people to work harder, try hard and go further in what they do. Cooperation is an interesting way, but will never be as efficient as competition, unless the competition is not fair. But this is another issue.
