              As the saying goes "Never judge a book from its cover". It is true for all aspects of life. We, as humans, tend to get attracted to things which seems good to our eye. For example, if we are given a opportunity to choose between a beautiful house which has two bedroom and 3 bathroom which are average in size; and a large dingy looking house which has five bedrooms and three bathroom which a big lawn and living area, we will be more interested to buy the first house just because of its beauty.              When it comes to marketing industry, the sellers usually go for appealing slogans and advertisement to attract more customers and as a result the demand for that certain product increase. They use rhetoric appeals to gain confidence and influence the audience. It is the same with real life problem. We often face trouble finding the right life partner for ourselves as we are poor at judging people and cannot see through the face mask each person puts on.               I agree that images and impressions have too much effect on people, sometimes it works on favor and sometimes it does not. So, appearance can be deceptive as we have been seeing since the ancient times, when the serpent in the garden of Eden lured Eve to eat the pleasing looking apple in order to gain knowledge and wisdom. I wonder if the apple was rotten and old, would Eve consider to eat it? I think no.               Thus, appearance and luring images can be used in many fields, like movies where the actresses are made to look appealing to our eyes. It is even true when we go to a nice a coffee shop, which looks beautiful from outside with strings of light and colorful flowers, but the actual coffee taste really bad.                 The power of images is very powerful yet most of the time it is deceptive if not understood and perceived in the right manner.
