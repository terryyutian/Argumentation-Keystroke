Cooperating is a much more difficult task than competing. Cooperating means finding compromises, being able to listen and to accept other people's opinion. I personally find it very difficult to work in a team, because I usually want to express my own ideas and to work "my way" without accepting compromises with the others' point of view. In spite of this personal difficulty, I am convinced that "you can go faster if you are alone, but you can go further if you are with someone else". During high school I had the opportunity to study with my classmates many times before tests and exams. Sometimes they needed my help with a subject, and sometimes I needed their help with another. I realized how studying together is useful and effective particularly when it was them who needed my help. When they asked me questions, I was forced to think and to explain things clearly, and sometimes I also realized I did not know the answers to basic questions!I usually have fun competing. However, competition can drive people crazy. They may become too arrogant for their success or too depressed for their failures. When at high school I wanted to be the one with the highest mark and I did not succeed, I remember I was strongly disappointed, angry and sad. This feeling of failure because of someone else's success is terrible.Cooperation can free us from this constant race between each other and help us build stronger and more healthy relationships. Aristotle said that "man is a social animal". I am convinced this is true. Sometimes it is way easier to stay on our own and to walk our own path, but this solitude cannot last forever. If people are together, they can help each other and wait for one another is somebody falls behind.
