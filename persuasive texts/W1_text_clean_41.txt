It is true that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. People these days looks at the outward appearance to judge what's on the inside. Despite the fact which says "Don't judge a book by its cover", many people still judge by what they see on the outside. Of-cause, the saying is popular and those who support it are also guilty of judging by the outward appearance. My father argues that it is irrelevant to argue that "don't judge a book by it's cover. "But a cover tells you what's on the inside", he says. People like him also argue that, when shopping, you don't want to waste time trying to see whether the materials are as good as they appear to be on the cover. In politics they also argue that how you dress yourself shows how your mind is set. This can be very true at times, but sometimes we get caught up with the outside appearance that we forget to dig deeper. It is when one has dug deeper into something, that they see the true nature of something or someone. Most products that are being sold these days are not what they appear to be like. For example, last Saturday, I ordered a pair of jeans online. On a picture, they appeared to be of great quality, but once I got a hold of them, they were just not worth it. This shows us that, we must not judge by the outward appearance. The effect created by images and impressions is just too much. We get attracted to the way someone appears, on televisions as well. Most people get hired as television hosts because of their outward structure, the way they dress and their good looks, while neglecting the ones who are more intelligent, but yet, lesser beautiful. This lowers the standards of our intelligence. Of all the things we value, appearance should be the last thing to be considered on the television, entertainment, and politics. Even though appearance is of some important, it should not be our first priority, because the content is much more important.
