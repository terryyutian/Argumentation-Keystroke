We live in a society in which everything is based on appearance. Even if you are extremely talented, skilled, if your appearance is not good, your chances to succeed will be smaller. Society definitely focuses more on the superficial. It is a pity, I believe, because appearances, good images eventually fade away, and if your have nothing else but your physics, at some point in your life, you will be left with nothing.Apart from that, focusing on appearance is very unfortunate because you miss on getting to know people in depth. You may refuse to get to know someone just because this person's appearance is not attractive to you but little do you know that this person is a very nice, smart, generous and funny human being. I keep blaming people for being too superficial and focusing very little attention to inner beauty but, actually, it is not our fault that we tend to give more credit to appearances. We are conditioned by society to believe that if you have a good image, you will be more appreciated, more successful in every aspects of your life. The medias keep showing us images of good looking people, and telling us what to do meet society standards of beauty, appearance. At a very young age, children learn through advertisements, that they have to have a certain appearance to be considered beautiful.This is something that has to change, we should teach people that not only is beauty totally subjective but that it is also within. We should teach people to focus more on the content of things and less on appearance.If everyone focused on the content of things, on the personality of people, our society would be way more advanced and kinder.
