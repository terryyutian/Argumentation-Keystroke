I believe that both cooperation and competition are mutually inclusive because they need each other to thrive to gain the most effective success. Competition drives the individual to fight and restlessly challenge themselves and others. Competition is also mostly an inner battle with oneself to always end on top, and without a personal challenge or motivation, an individual can neither excel nor rise to the top. But I also believe that cooperation is mutually beneficial because an individual can only take themselves so far. After a while cooperation is needed to push past a person's individual achievement because certain doors and opportunity can only be achieved with the help of others. And with the help of others through cooperation, lasting achievements are made that allow the individual as well as the group to rise.
