I believe images and impressions have an effect on people because that what people usually see first. Unfortunately based on appearances one can misjudged people or products. Because of that one need to be careful on the image he or she projected. As I said earlier images have a huge impact on people; a colorful image surrounded with geometric forms will easily be captured by our brain, while a black and white image will easily be forgotten. According to my Marketing 3010 teacher, advertisers spend a lot of time creating images with huge impact because they know their importance.  Impressions have also an effect on people. Imagine this is the first time I meet you, then I greet you warmly. But when you greet me back your voice volume is lower, and you are not giving me eye contact. After our first meeting, I can conclude that you are a shy person, or an introvert. As a college student, I see the importance of impressions during career fair events. Here at Robinson College of Business, we are taught on the importance of giving good impressions to our future employers during interviews and networking events. Talking to your future employer with a gum in your mouth shows that you are not respectful.  Even though a person gives you good impression, only time will reveal the true reality of who this person really is.
