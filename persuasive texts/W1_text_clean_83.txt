As rivalry between people increase, the need for perfection and greed for success increases as well. However, by being too competitive, hazardous amounts of personalities could develop as greed takes over. By being cooperative, although if one begins to lack behind, he or she will eventually learn that the cooperation could fail if he or she does not do his/her job well. One example of how rivalry is not a good practice is by winning or losing, the winner could get overconfident in his/her abilities, while the loser stays underconfident. This soon leads to a huge gap between each other, where they aim for the same goal, but have a unhealthy relationship with one another. The Cold War is a perfect example as both the United States and the Soviet Union both compete each other for who has more nuclear warheads, but are in bad terms with each other due to one trying to spread communism, while the other tries to maintain democracy. As the fear of communism spread to the United States, people began to doubt each other because of potential "spies" that could have infiltrated the United States government. This soon led to a political uproar and distrust among as people began to witch hunt one another. A mutual trust is needed between two people to decide on how the future is decided. By having a mutual relationship, both parties can reap benefits from each other as they know the other one has an ability that one does not have. In economic terms, a trade is made between one another because a person or a country can produce one thing, but cannot make. A person cannot last by solely himself on this planet. A companionship with one another is what sets us together and living in the brighter future on this planet.
