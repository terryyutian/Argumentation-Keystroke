In my opinion, there should be a balance between cooperation and competition in order to achieve success. On the one hand, cooperation has proven to be one of the most effective method in not only schools but also companies. When people cooperate, they will gain a better insight into themselves and into their teammates. Therefore, it is much easier for everyone to discuss and speak their minds in such negativity-free environment. Cooperation also means that people can share their work and help others in order to reach the mutual goal of efficiency. They understand that they need to rely, not fight against each other to get the work done. In this situation, better understanding, dependence and unity will be given way. Once a person know how to cooperate, he/she will know how to moderate his/her personality and style of working to be able to work among diversity. That person might also learn how to give constructive feedback yet not arouse anger. As a result, he/she will gain a lot of advantage when coming to the real world and having to work with so many different people.On the other hand, competition can be a positive incentive. Having healthy competition will actually motivate each person to do better and even push their limits further. Working towards a goal or a prize that no one else would have can make a person become more ambitious and willing to do things out of their comfort zone. He/she can discover an interesting side of the work, the school, the company or even himself/herself, which is a great learning experience.In conclusion, I think the most significant, lasting accomplishments will only be produced if there is a combination of cooperation and positive competition.
