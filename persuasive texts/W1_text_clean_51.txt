Images and impressions are the most superficial things people notice when they are first introduced to an object, an idea or a person. It is human nature to do very minimal work so we base our conclusions on how people react or on how the object looks. If the 1person seems appealing on the outside, people create an assumption that they have good intentions. Or if an object seems appealing to the eye, people are willing to consume it. Therefore, images and impressions have a great effect on people.For example, when a person goes to buy a car. If given the funds, a person may choose a luxurious car over an economic car. The reason being that the luxurious car seems more appealing to the eye, even though it may have high maintenance. For people is it important that the item they buy looks good enough to impress other people. Another example may be of a politician. For example, Donald Trump promised many things, among them was building a wall. At the time due to the racial tensions and grudges people held, they sided with Trump without understanding the ramifications of their actions. When the president won, he did not only held up his end of the bargain but also made idiotic decisions against immigrants that can have a detrimental effect on the economy. People need to consider what is inside matters more. People need to have an open mind when they are judging and object or a person. We as people need to investigate more on the products or the politicians we elect. Choosing an object such as a luxurious car over an economic car because of creating impressions may be more costly. Or electing a politician such as Trump because of people's selfish desires can harm the entire country.
