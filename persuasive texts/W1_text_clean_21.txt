In my opinion, cooperation is a better way to achieve success than competition. While it is true to say that people are more likely to do their best if they are in competition, I think cooperation can drive people to have even better results. To begin with, when people are cooperating with each other, they can help each other. In that way, someone who is bad at doing something can be helped by someone who is good at it, and reciprocally. Cooperation is thus a very powerful tool to achieve people's goals.Moreover, cooperation is better than competition because it causes less stress for people. For example, at work, there is a better ambiance if people are cooperating instead of competing with each other all day long. As a consequence they feel better, so it may probably lead to better results or achievements. Furthermore, the creativity and the powerfulness of people is higher when they are with others. Indeed, they can inspire each other, they can talk about their views and debate over them, so they may improve other people's ideas or change their mind. In all cases, it is a good way to enhance its perspectives of success. To conclude, I strongly support cooperation over competition. Cooperation presents a lot of advantages for people in achieving accomplishments, that competition can't provide.
