The conflict between cooperation and competition is a difficult issue to solve because everyone is different and everyone works differently under certain circumstances. Some people are motivated by competition and some actually work better in a cooperative and teamwork environment. You will see that some people can respond well to insults such as, "My grandma can run faster than that!" in order to be motivated to perform better in running or any type of physically challenging activity whereas some people respond better to words of affirmation and encouragement. Depending on the environment, I think that cooperation is the better option because two brains are better than one and it is safer to go with cooperation that competition. Competition has more side effects on a whole group of people than active cooperation. When people cooperate and work together in a civilized manner, more mistakes are avoided and more ideas are given to offer a wide range of material. Though a little competition is healthy, cooperation is just the safe way to go.
