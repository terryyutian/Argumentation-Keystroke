In my opinion, people achieve more by competition.When there is a competition, people will have the pressure of failing, and start to come up more ideas. However, when there is a cooperation, the atmosphere is usually casual. Although thoughts are exchanged and progress might occur, the compromise that have to appear within the group is considerable. During a competition setting, it is usually individual work with nobody helping each other, means one have to tackle all the problems by their selves. If the person can manage to finish the tasks without being assisted, he must have learned how to solve the problem as a first-hand experience. Although competition usually has multiple losers, the survivors are true winners. Those are the ones whose abilities are indeed enhanced. Even if one losers can learn some serious lessons and apply them to their future life or even competitions.In all, this is my thoughts why people achieve more by competition.
