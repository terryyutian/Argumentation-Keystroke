For centuries, competitions have been a well practiced method throughout the world in order to either avoid failure or to achieve victories. However, some may still believe that in a complex system such as life, people need to stand for themselves and not for others. With complexity comes obstacles, and to overcome such challenges they must be performed together. In which, through group/cooperation performance is much more likely to produce valuable and long lasting accomplishments versus the competition method. Psychologically, cooperation will also involve critical thinking skills and team effort which benefits a larger group in a more positive way. If a cooperation were to face failure most likely its members would support one another and produce more effective methods in the long run. Versus, a competition involving one individual who deals with the burden and most likely isn't able to improve or support themselves with one mind. Thus, one can conclude that cooperation is more successful in, "producing significant, lasting accomplishments," a complex world versus a competition which wouldn't survive.
