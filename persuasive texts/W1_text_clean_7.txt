I believe people are under all kinds of pressure in different environment in different age. Competition brings in more pressures than cooperation. That is why a lot of company are focusing on team building rather than looking for the best in one's area. Cooperation make chemistry with different people that we work with. it helps us to find out disadvantage and advantage. So that we can know more about ourselves. There is an ancient saying in Chinese, you will find your teacher within every three men. People are talking about privacy, intellectual property rights. Drive us fewer chances to learn from different ideas and thinking. However, things would be different when we are working in a same project. Common goals under limited period of time, can burst people's talent to express their ideas. On the other hand, competition makes candidates under a very stressful, and close environment. They would not like to share the results of work until the last minutes. No second opinions would make the plan or work goes slower. Also, opponents would not like each others' work, that would blind the mind of accepting new concepts. Lastly, I strongly agree with cooperation would help people achieve more success effect than competition.
