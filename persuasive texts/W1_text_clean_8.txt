Competition is the best way to achieve success faster, as it creates an environment of stress between the competitors, this way people are encouraged to make quick decisions and think logical solutions to a problem more quickly than in a cooperative environment. This has the disadvantage of putting more pressure to an individual and the results are not guaranteed to success individually.Even if competition is a faster process, it does not mean that cooperation is ineffective, as cooperation is the best way to obtain results that are more reliable as the cooperating people tend to share ideas, brainstorm, and engage in debate about what the best possible solution is, it also rewards people as a group, so there is no chance of individual failure. However this option is more time consuming than competition, as there is no danger of failure and sense of stress for an individual. It also means that in the case of failure, the group as a whole will not succeed.In conclusion, the most important factor between the two ways of achieving success is time, as there is multiple pros and cons for either one of the approaches to success, different environments may require different approaches to reach a goal or an achievement and both can be great ways to achieve success.
