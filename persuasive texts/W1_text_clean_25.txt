Cooperation is a quality most children start to develop in preschool. It is important because, most of the time, it is easier to achieve a result in a team rather than by yourself. It can be learnt though building teams while playing board games, cooking together, or by participating in a team sport, such as volleyball or football. At the same time, one learns how to solve problems and agree on compromises because different opinions are frequent when people from different backgrounds and mind-sets work together. Therefore, team projects in schools are very popular, as well as campaigns for team spirit. Nevertheless, in my opinion, competition achieves more success. Human beings have always been competitive, and thinking back to the past, the word's biggest heroes have been single personalities. For instance, Caesar stands out as the leader of the Roman Empire not because he worked together with people, but because he focused on himself and how to achieve goals important for his life and well-being. Another example are singers who started solo careers instead of staying in bands, such as Justin Timberlake. Sometimes it is necessary to focus on one's individual skills. Competition drives you to get better at what you do because no one wants to be 'the last' at something. I realized this in physical education in tenth grade, when we had to sprint half a mile. The classmates who had to run against each other were generally faster than the ones running the task on their own. If one looks around in the city, one will notice that, for example, coffee shops of different chains are often positioned directly next to one another, due to competitive reasons. If you don't rely on another person, all the responsibility, meaning how good or bad something is, depends only on yourself. There won't be a person gaining the success for the work you did, because there will not be anyone self than you.
