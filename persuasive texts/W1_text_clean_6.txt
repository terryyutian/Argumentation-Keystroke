In Ethiopia, we have a saying- " 50 lemons is a burden to one guy, but is a reward for 50 people". This means that where partnership and group work is involved, our tasks become feasible. I could definitely say that I have learned more in doing group works than studying to beat someone else. And it was definitely more fun running relay than the sprints in school. Why? We feel the positive attitudes of other people when we work with them. We get their support, and their advice. Why are successful companies not run by a single person only? Why do they have a whole office of people doing different type of work? Like the saying, the tasks become smaller and easier to do. Why do soccer or basketball players play in teams? Their game play becomes effective when they play with other people. Effective team work leads to rewards that cannot be achieved by solidarity.We tend to learn the important things in life when we work together. We make friends, learn to tolerate each other in spite of our differences. Which would be believable- if I said that I would make plenty of friends cooperating with people or competing with them?
