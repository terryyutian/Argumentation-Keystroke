There are two positions how to achieve success. Some people think that competition is way to achieve success, others emphasize the power of cooperation. The general question is how to achieve more success: by cooperation or by competition?From the one side, it is necessary to make cooperation. A big group of people can make the goal faster. The good example of this are companies. Big companies, such as Apple, Samsung, and others are more powerful than one person. The company can create something faster than only one person. The other example is group of sportsmen. For some sport it is necessary to do fast. For example, athletics run a big distance. It is easier to have team of five people to cross the distance, than cross for one person.From the other side, competition is very important in person's life. Competitions help each other to be on the first position. For example, artists cannot cooperate in single-singing. For each person it is very important to sing a song as best as possible. Also, it is important to make competition in some exercises in class. Students should take difficult tasks to understand who can make it easier and faster. To conclude, there are two positions of achievement of success: competition and cooperation. From the one side, cooperation is good way because it unite people, and help to achieve their goals. From the other side, people should do some things by themselves because in some situation they should be the best.
