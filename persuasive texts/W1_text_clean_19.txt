A lot of movies and books talked about how competition can make people success. But I think people achieve more success by cooperation than by competition. No one can build a building by himself; but if people work together, they can make anything happen.  Some people will say, in the games, you have to win by the competition; but the game needs all the players' cooperation to make it work. Competition is a way to make you developing your skills or works. But the way to the success is getting together by cooperation.  Competition is a way to be success, but I think people achieve more success by cooperation.
