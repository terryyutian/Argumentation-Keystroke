How many time you have heard this clause: "Dress to impress?" More than one time, right? As college students, who learning and working in a semi-professional environment, we are constantly reminded to dress up professional in important events in order to land a potential internship or a job offer. Have you wonder why? Psychologists have scientifically proved that human tend to develop positive attitudes toward a stranger if they are impressed by the way that person dress. However, in my opinion, images and impression have too much of an effect on people.In our society, we are taught to not judge someone based on their race, color, ethnicity or any other obvious characteristics. We should get to know the person's background, value, and skills before many any judgement. However, in reality, most of hiring manager make the decision whether to hire an employee solely based on their first impression on that person, mostly comes from how they dress. We think we can assume a stranger's life story and make prediction their work behaviors based on the first image. The fundamental attribution theory helps us understand why we make these assumptions, and still, we ignorantly have negative attitude or even discriminated action against these individuals. Psychologist also proved that people tend to like people who are similar to them in physically or mentally.  Liking is one of the most important factor in persuasion technique. If someone like you, you have much higher chance to convince them to do something they originally do not intend to do. That is why companies use influential, famous people to advertise for their products. There public figures has project images that many people can relate to or dream to be, which give them the power to influent. Lastly, I understand why images and impression have effects on people. However, it is overused by many companies or politicians. As students, we must listen and analyze what they said, not only what the.
