In the society that we are living appearances is the most important feature. The majority of people value more the external features than the internal self of a person. The character and morals come to second place when they need to judge a person. The media and TV advertisements are causing an enormous damage in our kids and teenagers. They are promoting an unhealthy view of what a person should be. The standard of beauty are impossible to achieve, and it is causing in the society to be more depressed and anxious to meet an standard that it was created by Photoshop. I understand that advertisement companies have to sell the products that they are representing, but they also have to take into consideration how certain types or visual aids in the advertisement will affect their clients. Even grow-ups are being affected by these twisted advertisements on social media, magazines or TV. For example, Actresses that just gave birth and they recovered their figure sooner than an average mother, who does not have a dietitian and a personal trainer nor a babysitter to take care of the baby when she is working out to recover her figure. I am not saying that is wrong to recover your silhouette sooner than later. But we need to work in redefining advertisement and show that everyone is unique and being different is fine and beautiful. We should focus in creating better morals and how to create good relationships between neighbors rather than how to lose the extra pounds or you need to start using Botox at 25 to decreased the pass of the time.
