For as long as man has existed, he has been inevitably drawn to beauty and appearances. It is simply innate and a part of human nature. A young child who has been asked to choose between a donut which has pink icing and colorful sprinkles on it or a plain donut would most likely select the former even if the tastes were exactly the same. As the clich√©, overused quote goes, "don't judge a book by its cover." However, many if not most of the American population today are guilty of just that. Science describes it as the "Halo Effect," a phenomena in which people have a tendency to believe that individuals whom appear better, actually are. This has become increasingly prominent in the 21st century with a plethora of new technological inventions and discoveries that allow for the mass proliferation of images, photographs, and videos. Moreover, the emergence of social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter has this effect as well. On Instagram, those accounts which have amassed a significantly large number of followers and likes usually receive more praise and respect regardless of what they choose post. This is because having a large following often sends a false impression of superiority to the viewer. Even dating apps have become victim to this. On Tinder, the first impression is not given by the description of the person, but rather by his or her looks. Before even reading their biodata, the mind has already come to the conclusion of "Hot or not." Studies also reveal that in job hiring, taller and more attractive men and women are more likely to sack the job position than another person with equal.
