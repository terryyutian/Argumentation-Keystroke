In the recent times, there have been a lot of discussions about whether images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Though, this topic has caused divisions among scholars, I believe that images and impressions have a huge impact on people. Among the reasons why images and impressions have an influence on people, one can cite the power of images and the idea that images actually convey.Images have a power that influence our perceptions of things around us. It is often said that a picture is worth more than a thousand words and that is also true for images. We are in a digital era and our brains are constantly expose to images for these reasons, images have become the very foremost element that people look at whether they want to learn about a person or something else. Images have actually determined our impressions and our feeling about things around us. For example, a good image on a advertisement spot can make us crave for and buy something we would not have bought otherwise. That is why marketers are really tedious about the images they articles.  Not only do images have power, but they also carry ideas and suggestions. Those ideas definitely influence our choices and determine our very impressions about products or items we see. For example, an image of famous basketball player drinking delightfully a certain drink may make think that if I want to be like that basketball player I must drink the same drink. Also, an image of a desperate cat can give the impression that cats are in danger and something has to be done about that. For those reasons, images have non negligible impact on people.It is true that to topic on images and impressions effects on people is a subject of division among intellectuals, but it cannot the gainsaid the fact that images and impression have power and also carry ideas which somehow influence people.
