In my opinion, images and impressions do have an effect on people. In today's society, people are much more judgmental than they used to be. Many factors have contributed to this attitude, mainly social media tied in with celebrities, as well as how far away people are, even though they could be sitting next to each other. The internet and social media has created small groups, each with their own sense of community, which restricts users from actually talking and communicating to people in real life. Basically, people would rather text someone over their phone because there is much less risk involved. People have become very judgmental because they are used to distancing themselves from other people, never really getting to know them. The same goes for purchased goods and public figures, people don't really know what's inside a food package, or whatâ€™s going through someone's head. They tend to judge based on what they've experienced before, an example could be a woman thinking "all men are the same" after she is broken up with. I truly believe in first impressions, when people meet you for the first time, they will continue to think of you the same way they thought of you when you first met, therefore, impressions and how someone presents themselves have a great effect on people. Which is why some companies don't really use their food for advertising, for example, some cereal companies put glue in a bowl rather than milk, then add the cereal to give it a fresh and glossy look. This in turn makes people want to buy cereal and it's not as good as it was advertised to be. Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people, it basically controls a big part of their decision making.
