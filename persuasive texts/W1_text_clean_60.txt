People see things before they start to feel things; thus, images and impressions become an important factor in how we think of the person or the thing later. For example, when people perceive food in colorful packages, they will buy them because they are assuming that the food will just be as good as what the packages look. Because there is not a way to actually tell the difference between the tastes of the food in colorful packages and the tastes of the food in simple packages, people usually buy the one that is visually appealing. Therefore, it is often the case that people tend to prefer the food in fancy packaging over the food in simple packaging. The similar conclusion can be made with how we perceive a person. When people see a person who is well-dressed on the street, we will think that person is presentable, intelligent, and attractive. However, when people see a person who seems to be under-dressed or poorly-dressed, we will think that person is un-presentable, filthy, and maybe they will even distance themselves from him or her. Of course, the person who poorly-dresses may be smarter and nicer than the person who dresses well, but since people have already forced the biased opinion about him or her, it is hard for those opinions to change.
