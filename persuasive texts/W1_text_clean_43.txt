I believe images has a lot of effect on people because what we see might not be exactly what that particular thing depicts. For example, when we shop online what we see online after is delivered to us may either be smaller or bigger also may not come out to be what we expected. With the age of technology growing really fast pictures could be edited and look way better than it appears in reality. What we see on the outside does not really tell us much about what is on the inside. We look at people who hold high position in our society and just assume because they come out wearing good clothes and shoes, also riding latest cars and live in a very big house everything is going pretty well in their lives.
