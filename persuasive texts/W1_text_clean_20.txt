                       In our current world, which is quite big, complicated and partly unknown, competition and cooperation are the two opposites. You can either choose to compete in order to reach your goals, or you can cooperate and try to reach your goals with other people in a more 'sympathic' way.                      First of all, I think that to compete can be, in some cases, great or at least useful. Indeed, it allows you to go further, that is to motivate you in order to reach success. This way, you can push your limits and improve yourself. It can also permit you to make great things and have the merit for yourself. For example, competition can be good for your ego and for yourself in general if you go to an exam limited in candidates and you have it. In this example, having the exam can be really good for you. Competition is a way to motivate yourself. Indeed, knowing that you are not the only one to go to the exam can motivate you to work on it and maybe do some things you would not have been doing if you were not in competition. Therefore, in some cases, competition can be useful.                      Nevertheless,  I think that most of the time, competition leads to tensions. Indeed, I do not really believe in competition because it means that you erase some other people who are just less lucky or talented than you. To compete means, in a certain way, to fight against someone and I think that if you lose, you will be angry and think it is unfair whereas if you win, you will find it normal and you will be glad. Competition can be hard and lead to bitter victories. Moreover, I think the best achievements are made by people who are not trying to compete. Indeed, working in cooperation can lead to better results. You listen to others, you discover new points of view and you can progress. I think that cooperation can bring more. It also seems more human than to compete with other human beings.
