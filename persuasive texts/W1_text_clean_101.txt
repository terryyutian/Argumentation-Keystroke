I believe people achieve more success by cooperation. Every person is an individual with background, experiences that are particular to that individual. That being said, more success can be achieved if people come together and work towards a common goal. Everyone gives their valuable input and the end result, because of the different opinions and ideas, will be more diverse and rich in its content. In moderation competition might be healthy to get people motivated and going. However, focusing too much on being the best or arriving first, an individual may compromise speed for quality. While cooperating and sharing ideas, individuals may motivate each other to dig more, come up with better ideas. Furthermore, a sense an individual may feel a sense of responsibility that the team in counting on him or her, which may motivate them to try even harder to not let the team down.
