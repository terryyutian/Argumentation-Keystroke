In my opinion, images and impressions does have too much of an effect on people. First of all, people always put their attention on the things which are colorful or when things are moving which is human being's nature reaction. In ancient, human use the ability of noticing the moving things to search for their foods. Nowadays, advertisements use this peopleâ€™s nature reactions to catch people's eye and their attention to make more profits. Sometimes, human can only distinguishes the things appear in front of their eyes instead of understanding their deeper meaning. This is why people always got lost and they do not have time to think about what the truth are. When we reading the books, the pictures are more obvious than its content. People always believe what they see at the first sight and seldom to figure out what the reality and whole aspects of the things they see. This is also the reason why people can be tricked very easily and there are a lot of magicians and lie appearing in the world. Images and impressions does have a lot of an effect on people. It could bring people the delight to enjoy the beautiful things and also do harm to people by the negative affections behind those beauty.
