In today's world, cooperation and competition both equally produce long lasting and precious accomplishments depending on the particular situation. Cooperation can create new ideas and in some cases even fix the existing ideas and make an useful outcome out of that. During cooperation, not only one brain, but several brains are involved and trust is built and through trust, the ideas would be exchanged, corrected and can be turned into great outcomes out the end which can lead to creating a new method, equipment, etc for a better life in the society. In cooperation, everyone gets somehow rewarded by the outcome and since it causes a satisfying result, it leads to a more united society at the end.There are also opportunities/positions that not everyone can reach in the society and they are only available to the best of best. For instance, for being a doctor, one must be so good at the job since he/she is responsible for the life of another human being. In serious situations like this, society only looks for the people with the best skills who are able to perform hard tasks on their own. There are other precious and rewarding positions in the society as well; some people might be attracted to them based on interest, money, etc but not all of them are eligible to be considered. That's when competition comes to place. Via competition, people become selected based on their skills, time management abilities, intelligence, etc and they will be given the tasks that the society trusts them to do. This will another way when trust is built in the society and they would trust that the people selected for the positions are eligible, responsible and worthy of their investment and time. cooperation would benefit society in general and unites people/ideas and would cause development towards a more modern and more united society. And competition would make a stable structure for the society and would maintain it through developing times.
