In my opinion, I think people achieve more success by cooperation. If we only focus on competition, it would make people become selfish and lonely. I think human being is made for gathering with each other. Therefore, the power and creativity from cooperation are much more better that competition. When we are thinking about competition, we would think of making ourselves success and try to make others failed. However, turns to cooperation, everyone would not only think about their own success but also think about others. This is really contributed to the creativity. Moreover, I think the process of cooperation is much more peaceful than competition. Cooperation is better for people to think positively. For example, people will think about what can I do to make the most benefit to our whole group, and people will work together to find out the reason when they face failure. For competition, people will only focus on their own benefit, regardless of others. And they could not easily to find out the mistake when they are working because they have only themselves. Although many people may think that when you success, you need to share the benefit with your partners, that will reduce your own benefit, if it is in competition situation, we don't need to worry about sharing the benefits. However, not only the benefit but also the risk of failure will reach the maximum in competition too.
