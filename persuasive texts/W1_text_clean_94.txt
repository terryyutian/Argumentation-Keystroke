          In today's society, images and impressions of certain things have become a vital role of how society runs today. Many people judge based on looks to pick who their role model is. For example, models shown on TV have gone though multiple surgeries in order to look good. However, people are deceived by their looks and try to be like them. Some people starve themselves just to look like these models. In schools, "fat" people do not fit into the "skinny" community and are constantly judged based off of what they look like. Long term problems may be starvation, health problems, anorexia, etc. Media also plays a large role on how images and impressions have a great affect on people. Some people may not understand, but things portrayed on media may potentially be lies. Media use marketing techniques to draw attention to customers.          People tend to like things that impress them that look good. Having the prefect body or speaking perfectly does not make someone good or a good role model. These things can be lies and may lead to a wrong decision in some cases.          Models shown on media, work out extensive amounts. Teens usually think they get that type of figure just by not eating, which is very unhealthy. If media shows then exercising and eating a healthy diet, then the viewer would do the same, which is another example of images having an effect on people. We do what we see.          Politicians are shown to be a powerful role model for the public. They show the positive impacts they have made on the environment, however this is only on camera. People do not capture what is off-camera, and base their opinions off of what is shown. Impressions, whether good or bad, effect the way people think. First impressions are everything. If you are having a bad day or mess up, then people may think you are bad and judge you for who you are not. The same way, politicians gain attention from the views on their first appearance.
