Everyone on this planet likes to achieve success, but not all people acquire the same ways to reach success. Some people favor cooperation while other go with competition.In my opinion, competition tends to shift from the goal of success on its own. It usually creates more of the tension between people in order to be better than other people and forget about the main goal which is achieving success.The best way to achieve success that lasts is definitely going to be with cooperation and not competition. The words may seem very similar but they are way different in meaning. Cooperation focuses mostly on team work and building relations with people. As well as, working on one project to help every single person in the group to succeed.  On the contrary, Competition strives the person to work on their own to achieve a task. In this situation, there is no place for discussion and opinions.If we think about success, we think about people sitting together discussing and giving opinions. Every person in this world has their own point of view, that's what makes each person unique. The reason why I'm saying this is because, in order to see achievements, you need more than one person to cooperate together in order to come up with something unique. One person on his/her own would never be compared with the work of a cooperated group.In conclusion, cooperation is the key method of achieving success. It all goes back to the fact that all people are different and that everyone has something to add to enhance anything. Competition can no way be the path to success and reaching the pure goal.
