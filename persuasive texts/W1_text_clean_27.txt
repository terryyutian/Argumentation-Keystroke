Personally, I think images and impressions have short effects on people. When a person first encounter a product or another person, they do not have any information about the others. Therefore, the first impression that comes to viewer's mind is the appearances of the product or the other person. A colorful, well-packed products on the advertisements on TV or in shops are more likely to catch the attention of the audiences and the shoppers. Likewise, the way a man dress to go on interviews or to meetings determines his attitude towards them -- whether he is serious and passionate or not is indirectly represent by his appearance. Thus, having good impressions or good images on the first time encountering new people is very important. Having created good impressions changes the mood of the viewers in a positive way, eventually grants better results for the products or the people. Nevertheless, impressions and images is not all that matters. The impressions and images do not have long lasting effects if the product is not well made and the person is not as good as we think he or she is. After sometime of usage, we may find the product fell short of our expectations. We would not use that product, that brand or recommend it to any of our friends. Users will abandon the product and eventually hurt the company the gives the false advertisements. Similarly, if a well-dressed man constantly show minimal efforts of doing his work, fall back on deadlines and not completing the amount of work he is required, all of the good impressions in the first place will lost and we would soon replace him. In conclusion, images and impressions are important, but staying true to those images and showing trustworthy impressions is what really matters. The society will automatically reject misleading products or unfaithful people no matter how beautiful their images or impressions are in the long run.
