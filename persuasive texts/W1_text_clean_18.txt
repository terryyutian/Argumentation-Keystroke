Compete or cooperate, I think everyone ask themselves this question. In my opinion the best way to do both. But outcomes could be different and we have to try to predict them.As an example my Business class I am taking this semester. I order to succeed and get a good grade I have to do my homework and study the material buy myself, but if I have any difficulties about topic I can cooperate with my classmate so both of us will learn that question better. Also for the same example, we have a group project which will have good part of finial grade. And again even though it is a group project I have to work on my part individually. So, for the question: " Should I cooperate or compete?" there is no right or wrong answer, the answer is what that person value most. Taking more about competition, I would say that it could be "dangerous" field. Competing people usually can forget about all other things in their life, and just see their success in the future, and do everything to reach this goal. In some parts it can harm the relationship with family and friends. As an example, there are so many families where parents was working so hard to be successful and get rich. But what happened in a few years? Lonely kids, with lack of love sitting at home and waiting for their parents, who gonna come home tired and probably wouldn't spend too much time for their kids. Cooperation in this case could be the equal amount of time adults will spend on work and family, and cooperate with someone at work so they complete the task faster. Being said, there is no right or wrong decision. We should plan and pretend what can happen if you choose on of the ways in your life and how you will benefit from that.
