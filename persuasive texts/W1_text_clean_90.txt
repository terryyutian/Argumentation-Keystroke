I believe images and impressions have too much of an effect on people because it changes how a person thinks about something or someone. For an example, if you are at an restaurant and there are pictures of the food; you will see the food looks so good. But then when you order the food, the food might not taste the best like you thought it would. Online dating is another problem as well because of images and impressions. Their profile picture may look beautiful and they might look very different in their picture. But then you meet the person for the first time, you realize the person looks "ugly", "different", and you were lied by the images. You cannot always trust the images you may see on the internet because you will be tricked or fooled. You will only find the truth once you have seen the real thing. Also talking to someone online can be false because the person can be pretending to be someone they are not. They act nice and clean. But then you can go to their house or you get the person mad. You will the real colors of the person. I personally can tell the truth and say I look better in pictures and while in person I might look different because of my makeup or the way I am dressed. If you looking to buy a house or car, you will see the images and you will be amazed how it looks. But once you go physically to the location, you will realize that it is not what you want. There are many instances in which you are tricked by images and have impressions because of what people tell you. I have gone through many times that pictures have too much effect on me and I thought the place was going to be great. But it was not what I expected to be. I was wrong and I was disappointed at the end. We live in a society where images are very important and we are affected by it. We should not let it have a lot of the affect but many people are visual and have to see it personal.
