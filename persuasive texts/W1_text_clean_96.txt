In a world where people strive to be successful, they mostly do it through the means of cooperation. Cooperation isn't the only factor that they rely on specifically, but it's the most used method to achieve more success. People may hate cooperation while others enjoy it, but in today's society, it's primarily used as a way to push your boundaries even further and strive for success. In competition. people compete with other individuals. This unfortunately results in stress and rivalry. It may in turn not help them in achieving their own goals. In cooperation, people look through the accomplishments of others to help motivate themselves. They are also given access to other people's knowledge. Now only will those who are cooperating with one another gain connections and networking, they are also gaining valuable primary and secondary sources of information. A quote that has been used for centuries goes by the saying of "Two brains are better than one.". This particular quote suggests that it is better to work together, in that, you will have more knowledge and understanding on a particular topic you don't know about. This, in turn, leads to success because you are working together to achieve a particular goal with similar core values rather than competing with other individuals. Recent studies have shown that by working together with your peers, you are more likely to produce significant results than those who compete with one another.
