In this day and age, I do believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Where I come from, presentation is everything, we judge people by their appearance. I don't believe images and impressions have always had that much of an effect on people, but somewhere along the way, the people in power managed to implement this in people's head. Your race, gender and social status contribute to that impression you can have on people. Take Africa for example, more specifically my country. Citizens over there would be more likely to buy a product they saw on a commercial being used by a white person or even just someone from a non-African country rather than one that would be advertised using an African himself. But can we really blame them? I, myself, once had that same prejudice and fell for these images and impressions. Impressions that are being enforced indirectly by our government when you see a local product that would cost three times less than that foreign product, and that builds this false idea that if it cost more then it's of a better quality. Another example of images and impressions having an effect on people can be clearly seen during an election, where the impression you make on the voters plays a big part. And in some countries, race plays a big part too. Some people are held at a higher standards just because they are from a certain race and some others, even if found guilty in the same offenses or worse, won't be held at those same standards just because they're from a specific race, you see this happening almost all over the world. Some have to work twice as hard to have what others are being offered on a plate. This is something that has been around for as long as humanity existed. There are countless examples I could give, but to answer the question, yes images and Impressions are everything in today's society.
