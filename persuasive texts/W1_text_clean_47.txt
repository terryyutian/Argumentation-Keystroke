Images and impressions, surely have a large impact on human's mind and this is one of the main reasons why marketing departments and communication agencies stresses so much time in finding the right image, symbol, picture, slogan in order to sell products and services to costumers.This technique brings many benefits to sellers, politicians and whoever wants to appeal people: it is the fastest and easiest way to make people be by your side. In fact, our mind is set to store images that capture our attention better than remembering long, boring speeches. Furthermore, images, slogan are one of the most important tools in the world. They have the ability to let you think what, for example, sellers want you to think about their products. Perhaps this is a controversial instrument, since it could be used to trick people, who are going to be amazed by a product without realizing that they are thinking about an idealistic product that most likely is not going to be as presented by commercials and ads.Perhaps images and fake slogan addressed to children should be banned, because it is so unethical to manipulate children to make their parents buy your services.Perhaps social medias and the internet revolution are destroying our society because people are spending too much time caring about what other peers think about them then creating strong relationships between each other.However, these are the instruments and facts that are shaping our century, the world we are used to live in and instead of stressing too much the fact that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people we should learn how to deal with them. An answer to this issue could be moderation, maybe we should implement some regulations that are going to let people understand that they might live in a biased world. After all, innovation is the key. Since innovation has brought as a world that goes far beyond the real one, why not wait to see what is going to happen next?
