Yes. I think images and impressions have too much of an effect on people nowadays.I feel like there are many people judge a person by the appearances. Just like what it said in the paragraph, many people will pick the nice colorful packages of items. It's the same effect.For instance, people will only choose those who are good looking as models in the fashion industry. It's the same thing. I can recall there was a YouTube video about the appearance. They did a social experiment to prove how important appearances are to people. They have one homeless people who wear very dirty on the street to beg for money. At the same time, they have another guy with suit and tie go out to beg for money. The result is not surprise me at all. The suit and tie guy gets more help than the homeless one. That shows how much the appearance can affect people's view.I think it's sad that people think that way. Everyone should be equal no matter how we look like. No one should be more superior to other people. We cannot judge a person by his or her appearance. Anyone can be next Steven Jobs. You never know just by looking at people. We shouldn't have stereotype and let the images limit us. In short, images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people nowadays. I think we need improve it.
