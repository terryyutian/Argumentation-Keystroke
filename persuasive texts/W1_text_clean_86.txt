Advertising is a result of a human desire or need. Marketing allows people to locate products that will help them feel at easy by fulfilling a need. Sometimes, the need is existent but consumers don't know where to find solution for it, or they simple don't know how to name it. Consumers solicit products to fulfill basic and specific needs, advertising studies those needs and provide solutions to it in the most simple ways. Images and impressions are then a representation of the needs and wants of consumer translated in product information. Marketing tools like packaging are shaped and adjusted based on consumers preferences. The way people, products and services are presented to the consumer serves a motive to invite them to try the product but can't be the only reason why consumers utilize it.  In some instances consumer select certain products based on what they see because this products serve many purposes. Socialization is one of them, buying a motorcycle can help them feel part of a community or a group. It can also serve as a tool to build the ideal self and project an image of the self to others. In that sense, images and impressions do have an affect of people but those effects are manipulated by the people not by Marketing or Media.
