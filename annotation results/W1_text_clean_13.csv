Once, my three classmates and I attended the school sports meeting for 400-meter-race. Each of us needed to finish 100-meter running and we had to decide the orders of the race. In this case, we had to have a well cooperation in order to win the first price. We spent spare time practicing together as well as exchanging own advice about the competition. At last, our hard work got paid off and we won the first price. If at that time, we only wanted to think about our individuals rather than the group, would we still win the first place?
