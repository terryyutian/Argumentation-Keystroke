What was once found fun or attractive may not be in a couple of years, with that so does society. People tend to believe that being beautiful can help you get away with anything. Many also believe that that is the goal. To be physically attractive is the common trend, and many will do anything to get there.","Lead (0, 476)",3,"s1p4|Final_Claim|0,78",-,"Nonannotated (0, 476)",-,-,-,"Nonannotated (0, 476)",-,-,-

"(371, 1152)",s1p2,"For example the singer Selena Gomez, is argued and seen as beautiful and attractive. What makes her so is what society describes as beautiful. A slim figure, a symmetrical face, and all around femininity. That being said she is also the most followed celebrity on Instagram, a social media platform. But just because she is beautiful, does not mean she is good at what she does. She is well known for her singing career, although many believe she just cannot sing. If whispering counts as singing then maybe she can, many argue that it is not the case. She is credited to singing ""karaoke"" style, as in singing along with her track in the background, many do not consider this actually singing. This is a prime example of how her personal appearance outweighs her singing abilities.","Data (64, 1152)",3,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,62",-,"Data (64, 1152)",3,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,62",-,"Data (371, 1152)",3,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,62",-

"(76, 822)",s1p3,"With television, movies, billboard ads, and magazines consistently showing thin and tall women as their cover girls, it is easy to see why so many are influenced to believe that they have to fit that specific mold. Unfortunately the majority of women do not look like that. So they take matter into their own hands. This is where cosmetic procedures come into play. Many women and men are compelled to go under the knife in order to look a certain way in hopes that they will feel better, and be treated better socially. People feel the need to do this to gain attention or just to feel better about themselves. To get attention from that man or women, to believe that they to can be on the cover of that magazine, drives many to extreme measures.","Data (76, 822)",3,"s1p3|Primary_Claim|0,74",-,"Data (76, 822)",3,"s1p3|Primary_Claim|0,74",-,"Data (76, 822)",3,"s1p3|Primary_Claim|0,74",-
