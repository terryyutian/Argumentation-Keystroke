"(475, 1380)",s1p1,"For instance, the very second you turn on any TV, radio or YouTube video. There is always an ad attached to it because these ads give out the best impressions on these products so consumers can buy them. And because of these ads companies all over the world make their profit. Although, this is great for companies because theyre making their revenue. Its not always the same way for the customers. Customers tend to very vulnerable when it comes to any products with a ""great deal"" or ""sale"" ""early morning bird special deal"" because these costumers believe that its a great deal and that theyre getting the most out of their money but are they really? We are in this so called superficial world where almost most things are fake. And because these ads give out such a fake persona of how the product really is that we as consumers dont really realize we tend to give in anyways and spend that money.","Data (207, 1380)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|91,205","s1p1|Data|1382,2431","Data (207, 1380)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|91,205","s1p1|Data|1382,2431","Data (475, 1380)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|91,205","s1p1|Data|1382,1886; s1p1|Data|207,473"

In order for someone to buy a product that was recently made, you would have to promote it to all these companies or else no one would know of your product. So that's the same type of mindset these companies have.
