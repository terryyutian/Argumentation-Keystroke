If both remain silent, none of them will be charged. If one of them blames the other one, he can go and the other one gets convicted. If they both blame the other one, both will be convicted. The participants are not allowed to talk to each other and they don't know how their partner answers the questions. A good solution for this game is to cooperate in the first round and then do what your partner did to you in the next round.","Data (0, 612)",2,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,158",-,"Data (0, 612)",3,"s1p4|Final_Claim|0,66",-,"Data (0, 612)",2,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,158",-
