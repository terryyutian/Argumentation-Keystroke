"(113, 687)",s1p2,"In a cooperation situation, some people are more likely to hope that others will find ideas for them. I play tennis and I will try to demonstrate that. When you play tennis, you have mainly two types of practice. The first one is to drill with your opponent (the goal is to improve your skills by repeating the same exercise many times). The second one is a practice match (you play a match against your partner). I noticed that I was trying harder when I was playing a match than when I was drilling. The fact that I am trying harder increases my chances to achieve success.","Data (113, 1194)",2,"s1p2|Final_Claim|0,111",-,"Data (113, 1194)",2,"s1p2|Final_Claim|0,111",-,"Data (113, 687)",3,"s1p2|Final_Claim|0,111","s1p2|Data|689,953"
