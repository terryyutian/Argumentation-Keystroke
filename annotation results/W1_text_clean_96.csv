Recent studies have shown that by working together with your peers, you are more likely to produce significant results than those who compete with one another.","Data (551, 1457)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|101,220","s1p1|Data|387,549","Data (551, 1457)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|101,220","s1p1|Data|387,549","Data (869, 1457)",2,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,99","s1p1|Data|101,385; s1p1|Data|387,867"
