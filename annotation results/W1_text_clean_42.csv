If you don't want to be in media and work on your advertisement daily, someone else with maybe less talent will get more media space and therefore, people will want more and more of its music. I was recently on Taylor Swift concert, and although I love her personality and am really fond of her, I was sort of disappointed when I saw her live. Don't get me wrong, she is incredible artist, very hard working and beautiful girl, but the first thing I thought when I saw her was - ""she is not the best dancer nor the best singer I saw"". So how come someone like Taylor, became so popular? The answer is advertisement.
