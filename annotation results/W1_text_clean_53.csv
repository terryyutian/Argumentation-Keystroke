"(326, 1221)",s1p2,"For example, Asian countries who promote competitive behavior rapidly increased their national power but could not surpass Europe or America. That's because after certain amount of time, competition becomes more of a poison than a helpful behavior. If people compete all the time for results, that means successful results can only be limited to one's boundary of result. However in cooperative system, result can be depended on many people's combination of ideas, which is usually better than just one person's idea. Single person competing against others and bringing results can be quicker since he doesn't have to spend time organizing or communicating his ideas with others, but his ideas will be limited. Many different people cooperating together might take a time to share their ideas and organize them, but they will surely have bigger and more successful idea than idea from one person.","Data (100, 1221)",2,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,98",-,"Data (100, 1221)",2,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,98",-,"Data (326, 1221)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|190,247","s1p2|Data|0,324"
