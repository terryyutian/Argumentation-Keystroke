"(0, 582)",s1p3,"For instance, people will only choose those who are good looking as models in the fashion industry. It's the same thing. I can recall there was a YouTube video about the appearance. They did a social experiment to prove how important appearances are to people. They have one homeless people who wear very dirty on the street to beg for money. At the same time, they have another guy with suit and tie go out to beg for money. The result is not surprise me at all. The suit and tie guy gets more help than the homeless one. That shows how much the appearance can affect people's view.","Data (0, 582)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,81","s1p2|Data|0,189","Data (0, 582)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|5,81","s1p4|Data|0,327","Data (0, 582)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,81","s1p2|Data|0,189"
"(0, 327)",s1p4,I think it's sad that people think that way. Everyone should be equal no matter how we look like. No one should be more superior to other people. We cannot judge a person by his or her appearance. Anyone can be next Steven Jobs. You never know just by looking at people.
