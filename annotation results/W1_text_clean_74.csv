"(203, 764)",s1p2,"Much like most coming of age stories the young adult featured in it struggles to figure out who they are, this is a fantastic example of how much harder it can be to find oneself specifically in today's society. With social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc., unhealthy behaviors are promoted, such as adolescence being distanced from real life interactions. This distancing leads to overall loneliness and unhappiness, with scientific studies showing a direct correlation between this and a rise in teenage depression, and anxiety rates.","Data (203, 764)",3,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,201",-,"Data (203, 764)",3,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,201",-,"Data (203, 764)",3,"s1p2|Primary_Claim|0,201",-

It promotes dishonesty and unhappiness due to the convoluted reality it creates, and tricks people into believing is real or even better than the life they could be leading with the people around them. Most importantly it creates standards for what is desirable and creates goals that most of the time are unreachable to the common person, while at the same time putting the people who can reach them on top. This creates insecurity and instability in people daily lives by contorting their priorities into things that don't actually make them happy, and more than often lead them down to wrong path or cause them to do things out of character.","Concluding_Summary (0, 730)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,156",-,"Concluding_Summary (0, 730)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,156",-,"Concluding_Summary (0, 730)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,156",-
