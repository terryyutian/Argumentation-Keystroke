"(0, 671)",s1p3,"By applying that thought, Asia has been always popular with plastic surgery. It has now became a huge stigma. As Asians - not all but majority - have what Americans or white individuals call 'small eyes'. No double eyelid, straight eyelashes, and so many features that just scream that they are Asians. By ""fixing"" those characteristics into more Northern Americanized characteristics, now many individuals from Asia now mix well and adapt North American cultures. Before plastic surgeries, I still remember, in 2004, when I visited the United States for the first time, no one knew where Korea was. This clearly states that the looks crushed so barriers between cultures.","Data (0, 671)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,222","s1p2|Data|0,423; s1p4|Data|0,838","Data (0, 671)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|224,456","s1p2|Data|0,423; s1p4|Data|0,838","Data (0, 671)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|0,222","s1p2|Data|0,423; s1p4|Data|330,838"

"(330, 838)",s1p4,"If one individual does not ""fit in"", one becomes depressed and later either change the direction of one's life or one's look. Most of the time it is the second choice, because it is easier. Even at job interviews, schools, any society setting, one will be constantly judging each other by their looks. This should be changed; not even decades ago, Americans were discriminating individuals with different shades of colors; how ironic, and what are the best selling products in the stores?
