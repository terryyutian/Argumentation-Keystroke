"(0, 487)",s1p1,"In order to answer the age old question of cooperation versus competition in terms of which yields greater success, we must first establish a consensus on what defines success. Since we are describing these two terms in a work environment, it is fair to assume success is measure based on position in the company and salary/income. Success is born out of many things, including cooperation and competition, but it in our terms we will determine which one yields a higher level of success.","Lead (0, 487)",3,"s1p4|Final_Claim|0,414",-,"Nonannotated (0, 487)",-,-,-,"Nonannotated (0, 487)",-,-,-
