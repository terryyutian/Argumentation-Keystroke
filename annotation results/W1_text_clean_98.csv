"(0, 489)",s1p1,"Social media is a tool used by many people to advocate for what they believe in or to just know about all that is happening around the world. Some others use it to promote their brand, and in order to do so, they sometimes portray an image of themselves that is not real. This in turn, leads their viewers and/or followers into building some sort of anxiety towards themselves because they do not look or dress or even have the same lifestyle as the Instagram or twitter ""guru"" they follow.","Data (0, 489)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|491,572","s1p1|Data|574,1458","Data (0, 489)",1,"s1p1|Final_Claim|491,572","s1p1|Data|574,1458","Data (0, 489)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|491,572","s1p1|Data|574,1458"

"(574, 1458)",s1p1,"Teenage girls are mostly affected by this. On the social platform called Instagram for example, other women that they admire might have a ""tiny waist"" with a ""flat tummy"" and round buttocks and get so many likes on their pictures. This might serve as a motivation to some of those little girls, but when those teenage girls look at themselves, they lack all of these features. Some might fall into depression and start hating their bodies, not knowing that the women they admire might just be ""posing"", meaning they do not actually look this perfect in real life. Those little girls could never imagine that the women they admire also have their own insecurities. In older women, this perfect body fantasy might lead them to getting a surgery, which might do even more damage to their bodies. This is just one aspect of the tremendous effect that images and impressions have on people.","Data (574, 1458)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|491,572","s1p1|Data|0,489","Data (574, 1458)",1,"s1p1|Final_Claim|491,572","s1p1|Data|0,489","Data (574, 1458)",3,"s1p1|Final_Claim|491,572","s1p1|Data|0,489"
